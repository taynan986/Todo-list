# About the project
This is a todo list project made in less than one week for me to learn the workflow of Express and MySQL.

# Instructions
The creation statements necessary for recreating the MySQL database and tables for the project to run are located in the "db.sql" file in the "mysql" folder. The credentials in app.js also must be set accordingly.
